# Arctic Oil Spill Risk Assessment
Arctic Oil Spill Risk Assessment (OSRA) Products as generated by Axiom Data Science in collaboration with Alaska Ocean Observing System.

In 2016 The Alaska Ocean Observing System was awarded a National Academy of Sciences Synthesis award on the topic "Synthesizing AIS ship tracking data, GNOME oil spill model results, and subsistence use information into a unique, interactive tool to aid research and planning in coastal communities bordering the Alaska Beaufort Sea". Along with Axiom Data Science and Stephen R. Braund & Associates (SRB&A), the work was completed in November of 2018. The project integrates data products describing vessel traffic patterns and subsistence use data from the communities of Utqiagvik, Nuiqsut, and Kaktovik along the Beaufort Sea coast. These datasets were used to generate an analysis of estimated oil spill risk to these areas and they offer a unique tool for planners and subsistence community members.

These jupyter notebooks are the code used to transform the final analysis products (vessel traffic, harvest and oil spill modeling results) into final risk analysis images and maps, as well as comparing models in other areas. Interactive versions of these risk analyses are available via Alaska Ocean Observing System.
